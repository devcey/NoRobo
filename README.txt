NoRobo is property of devcey, meaning only devcey is allowed to put NoRobo online.
The token has not been put into the repo for this reason.

NoRobo is just a small project I worked on. I sometimes just work on it and sometimes I just have months of break from it. I originally started on December 23rd 2020. With Alpha 10, the version currently in work, I will rewrite the whole bot and add slash commands.

Make sure that commands in "globalcommands" will also be in "commands".
